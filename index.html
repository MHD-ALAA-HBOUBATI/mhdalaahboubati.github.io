<p><b>John Von Neumann – Figure 1 </b>
Hungarian-American was born in Budapest-Austria Hungary in December 28, 1903 and died in Washington DC in February 8, 1957.
Finished his Ph.D. in mathematics in Pázmány Péter University in Budapest along with his diploma in chemical engineering from the ETH Zurich in Switzerland.
</p>
<p><h3>General information:</h3></p>
<p>
He was a Mathematician, Physicist, Inventor, Polymath and Polyglot and he contributed in  various amounts of fields.
He was one of the first four people selected for the faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in America (two of the others being Albert Einstein and Kurt Gödel)
He was a different child since birth (Child-prodigy), genius with numbers, memorizing and recalling information in an incredible way. He had the ability to perform complex operations in his head that stunned other mathematicians like Eugene Wigner which quoted on Seeing Von Neumann’s mind at work "one had the impression of a perfect instrument whose gears were machined to mesh accurately to a thousandth of an inch.” and many others who testified similar talents of him.

</p>
<p><h3>Contributions in Mathematics:</h3></p>
<p>
Von Neumann had major contributions in mathematics such as : Set theory, Geometry, Measure theory,  Ergodic theory,  Operator theory,  Lattice theory, Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, Quantum logic, Game theory, Mathematical economics, Linear programming, Mathematical statistics. In addition to that he also contributed in Nuclear Weapons where he developed the Explosive lenses technology used in atomic bombs which was needed to compress the plutonium core of Trinity test device and the Fat Man weapon [1]. Von Neumann was invited to become a member of the Atomic Energy Committee.
</p>
<p><h3>Contributions in Computing:</h3></p>
<p>
Von Neumann made a breakthrough computer science by using the memory of digital computers to store sequences of instructions and data, in fact while consulting for Moore  School of Electrical Engineering on the EDVAC project [2] Neumann wrote some notes titled ”First draft of a report on the EDVAC ” which is the modified version of IBM’s ENIAC, this draft formed the idea of storing the data and the program in the computer’s memory in the same address which is named afterwards as Von Neumann Architecture (Figure 2) which is a technique and a principle still used till today .

Another contribution of Von Neumann’s is the Field of cellular automata without the aid of computers. The first self-replicating automata was with a pencil and a graph paper.
He proved that the most effective way of performing large-scale mining operations such as mining an entire planet or asteroid belt would be by using self-replicating machines, these machines were the key to developing today’s CNC machines [3].
Von Neumann is also credited for his contribution in the study of algorithms where he is considered the inventor of the Merge sort algorithms, His algorithm is used in the software whitening stage of some hardware random number generators.
In 1956 Von Neumann wrote his book “The computer and the brain” which he discussed how the brain could be seen as a computing machine and discussed many differences between the brain and the computers in his days (such as processing speed and parallelism) and in this book he makes suggestions for the future especially in developing Memory which was a central theme in his book.
</p>
<p><h3>The Father of Computer Virology:</h3></p>
<p>
In 1949 Von Neumann design a self-reproducing program which was considered the world’s first virus and upon that he is considered the theoretical father of virology.
Von Neumann was diagnosed with either bone or pancreatic cancer in 1955 because of nuclear tests and died a year and a half after the diagnoses of cancer at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington D.C.
